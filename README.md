# Statamic 3

This repository contains the core code for the CMS. To build a website using Statamic, visit the main [Statamic repository](https://github.com/statamic/three-statamic).


## Testing

```
composer install
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

Until Statamic is released onto Packagist, we assume that you have the main project repo cloned into a sibling `statamic` directory.
