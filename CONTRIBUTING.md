## What You Should Know Before Contributing

### Statamic isn’t FOSS

Statamic is not Free Open Soft Software. It is **proprietary**. Everything in this and our other repos on Github — including community-contributed code — is the property of Wilderborn. For that reason there are a few limitations on how you can use the code:

- You cannot redistribute or use Statamic as a dependency in another project — open source or otherwise — without prior permission or licensing.
- You cannot alter anything related to licensing, updating, version/edition checking, or anything else that would circumvent our business model. We want to stay in business so we can support _you_ better.
- You can’t publicly maintain a long-term fork of Statamic.

### How to Get Support

If you're looking for official developer support (and you own a license), please go to [statamic.com/support](https://statamic.com/support) and we will always do our best to reply in a timely manner. **Github issues are intended for reporting bugs and resolving issues.**

You can chat and collaborate with other developers in the community — [Discord](https://statamic.com/discord) and the [forum](https://statamic.com/forum) are the best places to go. You will find many helpful folks who may be willing to help.

## How You Can Contribute

### Bug Reports

First things first. If the bug is security related refer to our [security disclosures](#security-disclosures) procedures instead of opening an issue.

Next, please search through the [open issues](https://github.com/statamic/three-cms/issues) to see if it has already been opened.

If you _do_ find a similar issue, upvote it by adding a :thumbsup: [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Only leave a comment if you have relevant information to add.

If no one has filed the issue yet, feel free to [submit a new one](https://github.com/statamic/three-cms/issues/new). Please include a clear description of the issue, follow along with the issue template, and provide and as much relevant information as possible. Code examples demonstrating the the issue are the best way to ensure a timely solution to the issue.

### Feature Requests

Feature requests should be created in the [statamic/ideas](https://github.com/statamic/ideas) repository.

### Security Disclosures

If you discover a security vulnerability, please review our [Security Policy](https://github.com/statamic/three-cms/security/policy), then report the issue directly to us from [statamic.com/support](https://statamic.com/support). We will review and respond privately via email.

### Documentation Edits

Statamic's documentation lives in the [https://github.com/statamic/three-docs](https://github.com/statamic/three-docs) repository. Improvements or corrections to them can be submitted as a pull request.

### Core Enhancements

If you would like to work on a new core feature or improvement, first create a [Github issue](https://github.com/statamic/three-cms/issues) for it if there’s not one already. While we appreciate community contributions, we do remain selective about what features make it into Statamic itself, so don’t take it the wrong way if we recommend that you to pursue the idea as an addon instead.

### Control Panel Translations

We welcome new translations and updates! Please follow [these instructions](https://github.com/statamic/three-cms/wiki/Translating-the-Control-Panel) on how to contribute to Statamic's translation files.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests should clearly describe the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if there is one. If the pull request fixes a bug, it should include a new test case that demonstrates the issue, if possible.
